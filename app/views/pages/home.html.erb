        <h2>Let us sweep you off your feet</h2>
        <p>Treat yourself and a special someone to a romantic retreat to a magical location. When you think of the word paradise, images of palm trees, beaches and waterfalls populate your mind. For many, thatâ€™s the epitome of paradise. For others, paradise is a getaway into the unknown with their significant other,  experiencing new things and seeing new places.<p>
        <h2>Treat yourself</h2>
        <p>Life is short, and thanks to Pink Flats, a romantic getaway with your loved one(s) is only a few clicks away. Why wait ? Give your partner the best getaway experience, and watch them be blown away. Your partner will never look at you the same again.</p>
