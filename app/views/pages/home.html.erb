        <p>Treat yourself and a special someone to a romantic retreat to a magical location. When you think of the word paradise, images of palm trees, beaches and waterfalls populate your mind. For many, thatâ€™s the epitome of paradise. For others, paradise is a getaway into the unknown with their significant other,  experiencing new things and seeing new places.<p>
